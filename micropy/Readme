* 1x Hobby Case for containing parts.
* 1x Waveshare RP2040-Zero
* 2x 2n3904 Transistors
* 2x 10kÎ© Resistors (for 2n3904 base current limiting)
* 1x PCB Board
* 1x 2.5mm to Bare Wire Female Plug
* 1x 3.5mm to Bare Wire Female Plug
* Wires and Jumpers for Connections
* Power Supply (if needed)
* Breadboard (if prototyping)
* Soldering Iron and Solder (if soldering is required)
* Header Pins and Connectors (if needed)
* Heat Shrink Tubing or Insulation for Wire Connections (if needed)
* Mounting Hardware (screws, standoffs, etc.)
* 1x USB-C Male to USB-A Female Connector

## Documentation

* [RP2040-Zero documentation](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm)
* [CircuitPython documentation](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/index.html)

## Instructions

1. Set up the voltage divider circuit for the HC-SR501.
2. Connect the PIR sensor to the RP2040-Zero using the following pin numbers:
    * PIR sensor OUT pin to GP6
    * PIR sensor VCC pin to 3V3
    * PIR sensor GND pin to GND
3. Connect the flash and camera to the RP2040-Zero using the following pin numbers:
    * Flash trigger pin to GP7
    * Camera trigger pin to GP5
4. Upload the code to the RP2040-Zero.
5. Power on the circuit.
